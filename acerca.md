###Juan Pablo Escalona G.

I'm a simple man, I'm sure about the things I love:  
I **in** love with my girlfriend  
I love my family  
I love climbing (bouldering specially)  
I love coding/programming/designing the world. From Assembly to **C** to Ruby to Photoshop. Anything that inspires me.

I'm currently a computer science(ish) student at [Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María][1]

####Skills

AngularJS, Laravel, RoR, C, MIPS Assembly, Photoshop, jQuery, CSS3, SCSS, HTML5, Git, Python, and whatever I want to learn in the future (Go lang seems interesting, Django too)


####Employment

I currently work as a freelance on small projects. It's hard to study and work for me. My only stable job it's maintaining [ChileClimbers.cl][2] one of the biggest climbing websites in Chile.
